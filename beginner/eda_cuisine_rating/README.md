# Customer Ratings and Preferences - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project provides an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer reviews and ratings for various cuisines. The goal is to uncover patterns and relationships between customer demographics, preferences, and satisfaction levels.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains 200 records with the following key attributes:

- **Demographics**: Gender, Year of Birth (YOB), Marital Status, Activity (e.g., Professional, Student)
- **Preferences**: Cuisines, Alcohol consumption, Smoking habits
- **Ratings**: Food Rating, Service Rating, Overall Rating
- **Location**: Area Code, Location

## Steps in EDA:

1. **Data Cleaning and Validation**:

   - Checked for missing values and duplicates.
   - Verified data types and performed basic summary statistics.

2. **Distribution Analysis**:

   - Visualized the distribution of Food, Service, and Overall ratings to understand the spread and central tendency of the ratings.

3. **Cuisine Preferences**:

   - Analyzed the popularity and average ratings of various cuisines (e.g., Japanese, Indian, Chinese).

4. **Demographic Analysis**:

   - Explored how gender and activity type (e.g., Professional, Student) influence ratings.

5. **Geographical Patterns**:

   - Investigated the relationship between location and overall ratings.

6. **Behavioral Patterns**:

   - Examined the impact of alcohol consumption and smoking habits on customer satisfaction.

7. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Checked correlations between numerical variables like Food Rating, Service Rating, Budget, and Overall Rating.

## Key Insights:

- **Cuisine Preferences**: Japanese and Seafood received the highest average ratings, while Filipino cuisine had lower ratings.
- **Gender-Based Ratings**: Female customers tend to give slightly higher overall ratings compared to male customers.
- **Activity**: Professionals rated cuisines like French and Japanese higher, while students gave lower ratings overall.
- **Geographical Differences**: Locations such as Upper East Side, NY, showed higher average ratings.

## Visualizations:

- Histograms, Bar Plots, Count Plots, and a Correlation Heatmap were used to visualize the relationships between variables.

## Conclusion:

The analysis provides valuable insights into customer preferences, allowing businesses to tailor their offerings to different demographic groups and regions. Further analysis could include predictive modeling to understand future trends in customer satisfaction.
